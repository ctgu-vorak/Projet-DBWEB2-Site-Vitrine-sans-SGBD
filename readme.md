# Showcase without Database
This project was a project at the end of the first French university year (L1 - Academic Year 2019/2020) whose objective was to create, for a seller, a showcase site on which he could present totally fanciful products.

Skills acquired at the end of April 2019, date of filing and oral defense:

- HTML5/CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Use of forms


Not surprisingly, we did not see database modelling or DBMS (DataBase Management Systems).

Thus, our "database" is fixed on a text file named 'base.txt'.



The defense and the project were a success with the following notes:

- 20/20 for the requested Project code.
- 20/20 for oral defence.



Another project aims to improve this project by fixing the data of the 'base.txt' file on a DBMS of type MySQL.
